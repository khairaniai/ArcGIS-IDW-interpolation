<h1>IDW Interpolation using ArcMap</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project builds upon the work detailed (https://github.com/khairaniai/Estimating-the-Onset-and-Cessation-of-the-Rainy-Season). The data obtained from the previous calculations were organized by year for each site. The onset values were then interpolated using ArcMap to visualize the spatial distribution of the onset across the Bengawan Solo Sub Basin.
